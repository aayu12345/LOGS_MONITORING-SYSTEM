# Log Classification With Hybrid Classification Framework
This project implements a hybrid log classification system, combining three complementary approaches to handle varying levels of complexity in log patterns. The classification methods ensure flexibility and effectiveness in processing predictable, complex, and poorly-labeled data patterns.
Classification Approaches
Regular Expression (Regex):

Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules.
Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression:

Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data.
Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.
LLM (Large Language Models):

Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
